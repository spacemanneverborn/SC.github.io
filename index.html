  Something to really think of...
<div>  Does it really matter to struggle when you know that you are gonna die someday.
  What really matters to me is living just as I planned
  (but planning is kinda arrogant and inflexible).
  Without having a deep sense of reality at life you will be proned to get
  anger (which is one letter away from danger)
  or disturb your mental peace for almost anything.</div>
<div >If you consider yourself mature by just being more serious at life then
  probably you are just losing the sense of reality that does it really worth it
And anyone who really wants to change something in this world should be more
humble and ego-free to really succeed.</div>
<div>â€œWhen you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it"
  -Paulo Coelho</div>
<div>It doesn't really unless you become your whole universe</div>
<div>I dont know what rubbish I wrote, I'm gonna publish this anyway...</div>
<div>I did not even read it LOLLL</div>
Please do not say Hi rudely, it really hurts.....
